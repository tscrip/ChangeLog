# ChangeLog
ChangeLog is a PHP webpage that was designed be a change tracking application. 

CL is writting in PHP and uses the SLIM framework for all of the REST opperations. Currently it is configured to use a MySQL DB, but because it uses the PHP PDO driver, you can use it with any SQL type DB.

The front end is written in JQuery, so it is extremely easy to make changes expand or modify the code to your project/organization. There are future plans to move from JQuery to Angular, but this may wait until Angular v2.0 comes out.
